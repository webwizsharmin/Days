# JavaScript Prototypes & Inheritance

This repository contains practical examples of how **Prototype** and **Prototypal Inheritance** work in JavaScript. Understanding these concepts is essential for mastering JavaScript's object-oriented nature.

## Concepts Covered

### 1. Constructor Functions

Using functions as blueprints to create multiple objects and adding methods to the `.prototype` property to ensure memory efficiency.

### 2. The Prototype Chain

Manually Linking objects using `__proto__` to understand how JavaScript looks up properties across the chain.

### 3. Object.create()

The modern and recommended way to create a new object using an existing objects as its prototype.

## How to Run

You can run any of these examples directly in your browser's console or using node.js.

## key Takeaways

- Methods defined on the prototype are shared among all instances, saving memory.
- Object.create is the cleanest way to establish inheritance.
- The prototype chain is the mechanism behind JavaScript's inheritance model.
